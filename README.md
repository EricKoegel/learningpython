# learningpython

This repository will just be a compliation of simple learning scripts I've created. It is also helping me work with Github and Eclipse. I'll be curious to see what I think of these files over the years as I progress.

In the meantime, I'm trying to figure out how to prevent Eclipse from uploading the entire structure and just list the .py files...
